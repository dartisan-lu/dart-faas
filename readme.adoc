# Dart - FAAS - Serverless

## Introduction

Build on https://knative.dev/ for local testing.

For local development and testing, I followed the instructions of the QuickStart based on Kind (MacOs): https://knative.dev/docs/install/quickstart-install/

Validate the installation with:

```
kind get clusters
```

Test with the image build from the project hello-world in the DockerHub Repo: https://hub.docker.com/r/dartisan/faas-dart-hello-world

```
kn service create hello \
--image dartisan/faas-dart-hello-world \
--port 8080 \
--env TARGET=World

Rollback: kn service delete hello
```

## Some useful commands:

```
kn service list
```

```
kubectl get pod -l serving.knative.dev/service=hello -w
```

```
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

## Troubleshooting

In case you see:
```
(6) Could not resolve host: hello.default.${LOADBALANCER_IP}.sslip.io?
```

you need to add ~sslip.io to DNS resolver 8.8.8.8 see: https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/first-autoscale/#access-your-knative-service
